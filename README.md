# Smart Notes Knowledge Management Systems

After college graduation, the ability to learn quickly from piecemeal information and organizing into knowledge systems is critical to both individual and organizational success.

Smart Notes is a software program designed to meet this need. The front end uses React.js and the back end uses Django. I will convert this app into a desktop program with Electron. The reason I'm using Django instead of Node.js for back end is because I intend to incorporate PyTorch machine learning capabilities in later iterations.

This is the project of my focus in 2025.
